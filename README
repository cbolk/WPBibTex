== Description ==
BibTeX plugin allows to add bibliography entries in a wordpress blog, supporting BibTeX style.

== Features ==

* input data directly from the bibtex text file
* easy inclusion in wordpress pages/posts by means of a dedicated tag
* possibility of filtering the bibtex entries based on their type (allow, deny)
* possibility to access the single bibtex entry source code to enable copy&paste (toggle-enabled visualization)
* expose URL of each document (if network-reachable)
* manage authors as single entity for further reference in the wordpress blog/pages

== Compatibility ==
The bibtex plugin has been developed and tested under Wordpress version 2.9.1. 

== Author's naming convention ==
* First
* Middle
* Last

If Lastname consists of several words, keep them together by using the ~ char (e.g., Danny De~Vito)
If the Firstname has two separate words and both are firstname and not first and middle name, then use
the  ~ char to keep them together as one (e.g. Li~Cheng Wong).


== A brief Markdown Example ==

When writing a page/post, you can use the tag [bibtex] as follows:

This is my whole list of publications: [bibtex]
If you want to filter the type of bibtex items, you can use one of the attributes 
allow, deny and cite, keyword and category as follows:

This is my list of journal articles (refer to the supported reference types, below):
